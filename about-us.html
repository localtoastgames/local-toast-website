    <h2>What we're making:</h2>
    <div>
      Our focus is currently on our latest endeavor; Project: Vantage!
    </div>

    </a>
    <div>
      Project: Vantage is intended to disrupt what we perceive to be an unfortunate state of affairs in the Virtual 
      Tabletop space. All Virtual Tabletops applications that we see in the market right now seem hell-bent on carving 
      out their own piece of the user-base and trapping them into an inflexible toolset that means that leaving the 
      application for a competitor means throwing out all the work they spent and exclusive education they've built up 
      using the app and starting all over with another app that will likely do the same thing to them.
    </div>
    <div>
      <a href="http://localtoast.io/project-vantage" target="_blank">Project: Vantage</a> is our passion project for 
      the Tabletop Gaming community, with a focus on 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. It will aim to disrupt the current 
      Virtual Tabletop space - seeking to open up the space and tooling so that Game Masters and players can more 
      easily switch between applications; ultimately making life much better for all Game Masters and players. We aim 
      to do this with unprecedented accessibility to our own Virtual Tabletop offering.

    <h3>Project Focal Points</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>User-Delighting</strong> 
        Project: Vantage focuses on creating a User Experience that delights; prioritizing User Experience over feature 
        bloat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flexible</strong> 
        Our philosophy for Project: Vantage is to accommodate for all kinds of Game Masters and Players (and 
        combinations thereof!). Groups that all want internal character sheets and strict rule enforcement should be 
        accommodated for, while groups with some players that want to play with pen and paper and others that want to 
        use D&D Beyond character sheet app. Groups that like top-down maps and groups that like isometric maps. Groups 
        that want to invest lots of time and effort into their campaign between sessions, and groups that improvise 
        epic storylines together as they go.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Streaming-Friendly</strong> 
        We want Project: Vantage to be the go-to tool for D&D Streamers. We think the low barrier to entry, pleasing 
        User Experience, and flexibility of our application will be especially appealing to streamers and we see our 
        tool as a way for many streamers to easily and effortlessly improve the production quality of their streams 
        (and positively impact the D&D community!)
      </li>
    </ul>
