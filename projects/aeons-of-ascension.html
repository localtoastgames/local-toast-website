  <h1>Aeons of Ascension</h1>
  <p>
    Aeons of Ascension was the first step in Local Toast's deliberate studio-building process.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the start, our plan for Local Toast has been to build a studio designed to disrupt the gaming industry; giving
    the gaming community the games and experiences that they deserve.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aeons of Ascension was us taking aim at the free-to-play space - particularly mobile RPGs.
  </p>
  <p>
    We love the nostalgia of old-school turn-based RPGs. And with the blossoming of mobile gaming, it seemed like the 
    perfect platform to develop some truly great RPG titles.
  </p>
  <p>
    But we really couldn't find any on the free-to-play mobile market. What we did find was an entire market of games that
    all showed very similar and troubling patterns:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Randomly collect heroes</strong>
      Very little opportunities for deliberate team building.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Linear Progression</strong>
      Most games had several linear Progression systems for their heroes; effectively resulting in very little choice
      for the player as to how best to build their heroes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Excessive Gating</strong>
      Play and often progression were heavily gated; and apparently only as a means for the game to incentivize players
      into more Real Money transactions to speed up their progression.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Lack of Co-Op</strong>
      No turn-based RPG we found had anything that resembled a satisfying Co-Op experience, which is such a shame given 
      that it's such an integral part of the mobile platform, and the gaming experience on these RPGs seemed so hopelessly
      isolated.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It all amounted to a a grinding treadmill. And not to disrepect these games, some of them were really well-engineered 
    and designed treadmills; giving players just enough power boosts at just the right times to keep them playing, or get 
    them to shell out.
  </p>
  <p>
    So we resolved to fix things, by making the Free-To-Play RPG that we wanted to play. One that would be truly rewarding
    to players.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Strong Team-Building</strong>
      Aeons of Ascension was designed to be allow players to easily customize and switch between configurations of their
      heroes to build teams explicitely for the purpose of defeating a specific boss or other challenge. It was also 
      designed to feature encounters that required that amount of optimization to overcome at the highest levels of play.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Linear Progression</strong>
      While Aeons of Ascension did have the standard linear progression RPG systems (leveling up), most of the progression
      was based on choice. For example, each hero could only enter battles with a set number of moves; but heroes could 
      learn a vast amount of moves in total, and would progress by increasing the number of moves in their library. As
      such, progressing meant building up more choices as to the moveset and equipment they went into battle with.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Open Play</strong>
      We never wanted to give a player the feeling that they couldn't play AoA (shakes fist at energy bars) or that they
      had done everything for the day and didn't have any reason to play further. We tried to switch most of that on its
      head with mechanics that bolstered progression with bonuses for your first games of the day; and these bonuses would
      diminish the more the player played until the next day started and the process would repeat itself over again.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Integral Co-Op</strong>
      We planned to highly incentizive Co-Op play in our game by increasing rewards for the more players you had in your
      party; with further increased rewards for continuing to play with players you had played with previously. Our Co-Op
      system was pervasive to the game; which was build on Web Socket technology so players could see their partners
      playing in realtime.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Launch</h2>
  <p>
    We launched a proof-of-concept in January 14, 2018. The proof of concept was a browser-based client that featured a 
    simple battle lobby with two preset teams. A player could:
    <ul>
      <li>Play against a computer opponent</li>
      <li>Play against another player</li>
      <li>Watch 2 computer players play against each other</li>
      <li>Spectate any game on the server</li>
    </ul>
    All the while we were testing our Web Sockets server for performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    From a technology standpoint, our launch was a huge success. Aside from a DDoS incident, we were able to keep our
    servers up and identify and implement several performance improvements that helped refine our Web Sockets 
    implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    From a business perspective however, we struggled to get engagement from users. We chalk this up ultimately to a
    very crowded on-line gaming space, and a User Experience that really couldn't stand up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Following our launch, we interated for 2 more cycles to try and solve our UX problem and increase our engagement, 
    before ultimately deciding to pivot away from AoA in March 2018.
  </p>
  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  <h3>UX and Art are important!</h3>
  <p>
    A user's experience of a game - and any product - really is paramount. Our Core Team at the time - Zack and Jesse -
    valued the user's experience, but lacked the skillset necessary for a proper design; focusing instead on what we 
    thought would be impressive technical capabilities.
  </p>  
  <p>
    Coming out of Aeons of Ascension, we resolved to refocus our company on User-Focused Quality Designs - essentially 
    a re-focus on the user; while maintaining our technical quality and capabilities.
  </p>
  <h3>Core Team Completed</h3>
  <p>
    To accomplish this goal, we added Josh Mace as a new Founder of Localtoast, who brings with him 20+ years of UX 
    design experience from the Enterprise software field, as well as 3 years of team experience with both Zack and Jesse
    in the Enterprise software space. (Not to mention 4 decades of Dungeon Master experience!!)
  </p>
  <h2>Possible Future Revival</h2>
  <p>
    Aeons of Ascension was very special project to us; in many ways our decision to pivot away from this project was 
    realizing that we had bitten off more than we could chew given our skills, experience (particularly experience in 
    the gaming industry), and influence at the time.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are totally open to relaunching AoA at some point in the future! Once our skills and experience and team is
    ready, it's very likely we'll revamp this project and give it the treatment it deserves!
